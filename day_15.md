   - **Q1**: Find the last login date of `Glitch_Malware` (DD/MM/YYYY).  
     **Answer**: `07/11/2024`  
   - **Q2**: Find the Event ID for the login event.  
     **Answer**: `4624`

### Step 3: Review PowerShell History
1. **Locate PowerShell History File**:  
   - Open File Explorer and navigate to:
     ```
     C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt
     ```
2. **Search for Enumeration Commands**:  
   - Look for commands related to AD user enumeration.
3. **Answer Question**:  
   - **Q3**: Identify the command used to enumerate AD users.  
     **Answer**:  
     `Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object Name`

### Step 4: Investigate PowerShell Logs
1. **Open PowerShell Logs**:  
   - Navigate to:
     ```
     Application and Services Logs > Windows PowerShell
     ```
2. **Search for Password Commands**:  
   - Use the **Find** feature to locate `$password` entries.
3. **Answer Question**:  
   - **Q4**: Identify the password set for `Glitch_Malware`.  
     **Answer**:  
     `SuperSecretP@ssw0rd!`

### Step 5: Review Group Policy Objects (GPOs)
1. **List All GPOs**:  
   - Open PowerShell and run:
     ```
     Get-GPO -All
     ```
2. **Identify Suspicious GPOs**:  
   - Look for unusual or recently modified GPOs.
3. **Answer Question**:  
   - **Q5**: Name of the installed GPO.  
     **Answer**:  
     `Malicious GPO - Glitch_Malware Persistence`

## Answers ‚úÖ

1. **On what day was Glitch_Malware last logged in?**  
   **Answer**: `07/11/2024`

2. **What event ID shows the login of the Glitch_Malware user?**  
   **Answer**: `4624`

3. **What was the command that was used to enumerate Active Directory users?**  
   **Answer**:  
   `Get-ADUser -Filter * -Properties MemberOf | Select-Object Name`

4. **What was Glitch_Malware's set password?**  
   **Answer**: `SuperSecretP@ssw0rd!`

5. **What is the name of the installed GPO?**  
   **Answer**: `Malicious GPO - Glitch_Malware Persistence`

## Lessons Learned üåü

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Monitoring Logs**:  
   Event Viewer is crucial for identifying suspicious activities like unauthorized logins and unusual commands.
2. **Reviewing PowerShell Usage**:  
   PowerShell history and logs can reveal critical details about attacker activities.
3. **Securing Active Directory**:  
   Regular audits of GPOs and user accounts help detect and mitigate potential breaches.

### Tools and Techniques üõ†Ô∏è
1. **Event Viewer**:  
   Essential for investigating login events and system activity.
2. **PowerShell**:  
   Powerful for querying AD objects and identifying anomalies.
3. **AD Hardening**:  
   Implementing secure configurations and monitoring policies to prevent exploitation.

## Final Thoughts üéÅ
