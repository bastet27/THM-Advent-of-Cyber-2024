# ðŸŽ„ TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024 â€“ Day 17: Log Analysis

## Objectives  
- Analyze logs to identify suspicious activity.  
- Extract fields from unstructured log data.  
- Investigate unauthorized access and deletion of CCTV footage.  
- Use Splunk to parse, filter, and correlate log data for detailed analysis.  

## Steps  

### Step 1: Analyze All Logs in `cctv_feed`
1. Use Splunk to load the `cctv_feed` data.
2. Run the query:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed
   ```
   Review unstructured logs to understand the fields and structure.

### Step 2: Extract and Validate Fields  
1. Use the **Extract New Fields** option to define custom fields:
   - `Timestamp`
   - `Event`
   - `User_id`
   - `UserName`
   - `Session_id`
2. Validate field parsing using sample logs. Adjust regex for comprehensive coverage:
   ```
   ^(?P<timestamp>\d+\-\d+\-\d+\s+\d+:\d+:\d+)\s+(?P<Event>(Login\s\w+|\w+))\s+(?P<user_id>\d+)?\s?(?P<UserName>\w+)\s+.*?(?P<Session_id>\w+)$
   ```

### Step 3: Investigate Specific Activities  
#### Successful Logins:
1. Query for logs with successful logins:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *successful*
   ```

#### Deletion Events:
2. Query for deletion activities:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *delete*
   ```

#### Session ID Correlation:
3. Investigate activities linked to the suspicious `Session_id`:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *rij5uu4gt204q0d3eb7jj86okt*
   ```

## Key Findings  

1. **Suspicious Activity**: Multiple login failures followed by a successful login for a suspicious user.
2. **Deletion Events**: Logs confirmed the deletion of CCTV footage.
3. **Correlated Evidence**: The same `Session_id` linked to suspicious activities in web logs and CCTV feed.

## Lessons Learned  

1. **Importance of Log Parsing**: Structured data aids faster investigation.
2. **Field Extraction in SIEM**: Accurate regex ensures comprehensive log coverage.
3. **Session Correlation**: Linking events across datasets is crucial for identifying attackers.

### Tools and Techniques  

- **Splunk**: For log ingestion, searching, and visualization.
- **Regex**: For custom field extraction.
- **Search Processing Language (SPL)**: For data filtering and correlation.


## Final Thoughts  
This task reinforced the importance of structured log analysis and correlation across datasets. It also demonstrated the need for enabling audit trails and regular monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.

### Answers  

1. **How many logs were captured associated with the successful login?**  
   **Answer:** `642`

2. **What is the `Session_id` associated with the attacker who deleted the recording?**  
   **Answer:** `rij5uu4gt204q0d3eb7jj86okt`

3. **What is the name of the attacker found in the logs, who deleted the CCTV footage?**  
   **Answer:** `mmalware`
