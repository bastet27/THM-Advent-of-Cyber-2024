# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024

## Introduction üñ§
Welcome to my write-up collection for the TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024! I'm thrilled to dive into each daily challenge and document my journey as I explore various cybersecurity concepts and solve intriguing puzzles. Each day presents a unique scenario, giving me the chance to delve into topics like malware analysis, web security, OSINT, and so much more.

As I work through the challenges, I'll be updating this repository with detailed write-ups for each day. While the repo won't be public until after the event wraps up (to avoid spoiling the fun for others), I'm excited to share my experiences and insights once it's over.

## Summary of Challenges So Far üåü
This year‚Äôs Advent of Cyber has explored a wide range of cybersecurity topics, starting with foundational skills and building up to more advanced concepts. In the early days, challenges like the **OPSEC Challenge** (Day 1) and **Phishing** (Day 10) emphasized the importance of secure practices and understanding social engineering tactics. These lessons were complemented by the **Risk Assessment** (Day 9), which focused on identifying and mitigating security threats.

Technical challenges like **Log Analysis** (Days 2, 3, and 17) introduced tools and techniques for examining logs to uncover malicious activity, while the **Atomic Red Team** (Day 4) provided hands-on experience simulating and defending against common attack patterns. **Sandboxes** (Day 6) and **AWS Sandboxes** (Day 7) delved into analyzing malware in isolated environments, with a focus on securing cloud ecosystems.

Web security was another significant theme, featuring tasks like **XXE (XML External Entity)** (Day 5), **Web Timing Attacks** (Day 12), and **WebSockets** (Day 13), which highlighted vulnerabilities in web applications and how attackers exploit them. Similarly, the challenges on **Shellcodes** (Day 8) and **Prompt Injection** (Day 18) examined exploitation techniques and mitigation strategies.

More advanced exercises included **Active Directory** (Day 15) and **Azure Exploitation** (Day 16), which explored securing enterprise environments and identifying vulnerabilities in cloud platforms. **Game Hacking** (Day 19) offered a unique perspective on security flaws in gaming systems, while **Traffic Analysis** (Day 20) and **Reverse Engineering** (Day 21) honed skills in analyzing network data and binary files.

Finally, **Kubernetes DFIR** (Day 22) demonstrated digital forensics and incident response in containerized environments, and **Hash Cracking** (Day 23) revisited cryptographic concepts, showcasing how passwords can be recovered from hashed formats.

Together, these challenges have provided an engaging mix of theoretical learning and practical application, offering a comprehensive cybersecurity experience.
