# Write-Up: TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024

## Introduction ðŸ–¤

Welcome to my write-up collection for the **TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024**! I'm thrilled to dive into each daily challenge and document my journey as I explore various cybersecurity concepts and solve intriguing puzzles. Each day presents a unique scenario, giving me the chance to delve into topics like malware analysis, web security, OSINT, and so much more.

As I work through the challenges, I'll be updating this repository with detailed write-ups for each day. While the repo won't be public until after the event wraps up (to avoid spoiling the fun for others), I'm excited to share my experiences and insights once it's over.
