# TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024

## Introduction üñ§
Welcome to my write-up collection for the TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024! I'm thrilled to dive into each daily challenge and document my journey as I explore various cybersecurity concepts and solve intriguing puzzles. Each day presents a unique scenario, giving me the chance to delve into topics like malware analysis, web security, OSINT, and so much more.

As I work through the challenges, I'll be updating this repository with detailed write-ups for each day. While the repo won't be public until after the event wraps up (to avoid spoiling the fun for others), I'm excited to share my experiences and insights once it's over.

## Summary of Challenges üåü

This year‚Äôs Advent of Cyber concluded with a comprehensive exploration of cybersecurity topics, ranging from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. The early days focused on essentials like the **OPSEC Challenge** (Day 1) and **Phishing** (Day 10), which highlighted secure practices and social engineering defenses. These were complemented by **Risk Assessment** (Day 9), focusing on identifying and mitigating security threats.

Technical challenges such as **Log Analysis** (Days 2, 3, and 17) provided hands-on experience in uncovering malicious activity through log examination, while **Atomic Red Team** (Day 4) showcased attack simulations and defensive measures. **Sandboxes** (Day 6) and **AWS Sandboxes** (Day 7) explored analyzing malware in isolated environments and securing cloud ecosystems.

Web security was a recurring theme, with challenges like **XXE (XML External Entity)** (Day 5), **Web Timing Attacks** (Day 12), and **WebSockets** (Day 13) shedding light on vulnerabilities in web applications and attacker exploitation methods. Related tasks, such as **Shellcodes** (Day 8) and **Prompt Injection** (Day 18), delved into exploitation techniques and their mitigation.

Advanced exercises tackled enterprise and cloud security, including **Active Directory** (Day 15) and **Azure Exploitation** (Day 16), which examined securing complex environments. Challenges like **Game Hacking** (Day 19), **Traffic Analysis** (Day 20), and **Reverse Engineering** (Day 21) offered unique perspectives on identifying flaws in gaming systems, analyzing network data, and examining binary files.

The final stretch brought focus to cutting-edge topics like **Kubernetes DFIR** (Day 22), showcasing incident response in containerized environments, and **Hash Cracking** (Day 23), which revisited cryptographic principles to demonstrate how passwords can be recovered from hashes.
