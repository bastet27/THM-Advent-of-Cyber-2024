# üéÑ TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024 ‚Äì Day 7: AWS Log Analysis

## Objectives üéØ

1. Analyze AWS CloudTrail logs to identify anomalous user activity.  
2. Use `jq` to filter and extract meaningful information from JSON-formatted logs.  
3. Investigate RDS logs to uncover donation hijacking.  
4. Correlate IAM, IP, and user activities to build a comprehensive incident timeline.

## Steps üöÄ

### Reviewing CloudTrail Logs
- **Filter for S3 Bucket Activities:**  
  Using `jq`, I filtered the logs for activities related to the `wareville-care4wares` S3 bucket:
  ```
  jq -r '.Records[] | select(.eventSource == "s3.amazonaws.com" and .requestParameters.bucketName=="wareville-care4wares")' cloudtrail_log.json
  ```
- **Refine the Results:**  
  Added relevant fields to focus on timestamps, event names, and user activity:
  ```
  jq -r '["Event_Time", "Event_Name", "User_Name", "Bucket_Name", "Key", "Source_IP"], (.Records[] | select(.eventSource == "s3.amazonaws.com" and .requestParameters.bucketName=="wareville-care4wares") | [.eventTime, .eventName, .userIdentity.userName // "N/A", .requestParameters.bucketName // "N/A", .requestParameters.key // "N/A", .sourceIPAddress // "N/A"]) | @tsv' cloudtrail_log.json | column -t
  ```

### Investigating the Anomalous User
- **Focus on `glitch`:**  
  By filtering for actions by the `glitch` user, I discovered two key events:
  - `ListObjects`
  - `PutObject`
  ```
  jq -r '["Event_Time", "Event_Source", "Event_Name", "User_Name", "Source_IP"], (.Records[] | select(.userIdentity.userName == "glitch") | [.eventTime, .eventSource, .eventName, .userIdentity.userName // "N/A", .sourceIPAddress // "N/A"]) | @tsv' cloudtrail_log.json | column -t
  ```

### Examining IAM Events
- **Identify the Creator of `glitch`:**  
  Filtered for `CreateUser` and `AttachUserPolicy` events to confirm that `mcskidy` was impersonated to create and assign `AdministratorAccess` to `glitch`:
  ```
  jq '.Records[] | select(.eventSource=="iam.amazonaws.com" and .eventName== "CreateUser")' cloudtrail_log.json
  jq '.Records[] | select(.eventSource=="iam.amazonaws.com" and .eventName== "AttachUserPolicy")' cloudtrail_log.json
  ```

### Verifying Source IPs
- **Track Malicious Activity:**  
  Correlated IP addresses across actions to reveal that `53.94.201.69` was used by `mcskidy`, `glitch`, and `mayor_malware`:
  ```
  jq -r '["Event_Time", "Event_Source", "Event_Name", "User_Name", "Source_IP"], (.Records[] | select(.sourceIPAddress=="53.94.201.69") | [.eventTime, .eventSource, .eventName, .userIdentity.userName // "N/A", .sourceIPAddress // "N/A"]) | @tsv' cloudtrail_log.json | column -t
  ```

### Investigating RDS Logs
- **Identify Donation Changes:**  
  Using `grep`, I pinpointed a sudden switch in donation recipients on November 28:
  ```
  grep INSERT rds.log
  ```
  The logs showed donations being redirected to an account owned by Mayor Malware.

## Key Findings üîë

1. **Malicious Actions by `glitch`:**  
   Uploaded a tampered bank account flyer to the S3 bucket, redirecting donations.
2. **Consistent Source IP:**  
   `53.94.201.69` was used for all malicious activities, including IAM changes and S3 uploads.
3. **Misuse of IAM:**  
   The `mcskidy` account was impersonated to create and elevate `glitch`.
4. **Donation Hijacking:**  
   Donations meant for the charity were diverted to an account controlled by Mayor Malware.

## Lessons Learned üåü

1. **Importance of CloudTrail Logs:**  
   CloudTrail logs are essential for tracing user actions and identifying malicious behavior in cloud environments.
2. **IAM Oversight:**  
   Monitoring IAM activities, such as user creation and policy changes, is critical to detecting potential abuse.
3. **IP and Behavior Correlation:**  
   Tracking IP addresses across events can reveal patterns and tie malicious actions to their origin.

### Tools and Techniques üõ†Ô∏è

1. [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/): Filtered and analyzed JSON-formatted logs.  
2. [grep](https://www.gnu.org/software/grep/): Searched RDS logs for specific patterns.  
3. **AWS CloudTrail Logs:** Tracked actions within the AWS environment.  
4. **RDS Logs:** Identified changes in donation recipients.  

## Final Thoughts üéÅ

Day 7 reinforced the importance of log analysis and correlation in cloud environments. By leveraging tools like JQ and grep, I was able to uncover a sophisticated donation hijacking scheme. The insights gained highlight the need for strong IAM controls and regular monitoring of AWS environments.
