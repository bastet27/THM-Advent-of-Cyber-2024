# 🎄 TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024 – Day 17: Log Analysis

## Objectives 🎯
- Analyze logs to identify suspicious activity.  
- Extract fields from unstructured log data.  
- Investigate unauthorized access and deletion of CCTV footage.  
- Use Splunk to parse, filter, and correlate log data for detailed analysis.  

## Steps 🚀

### Step 1: Analyze All Logs in `cctv_feed`
1. Use Splunk to load the `cctv_feed` data.
2. Run the query:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed
   ```
   Review unstructured logs to understand the fields and structure.

### Step 2: Extract and Validate Fields  
1. Use the **Extract New Fields** option to define custom fields:
   - `Timestamp`
   - `Event`
   - `User_id`
   - `UserName`
   - `Session_id`
2. Validate field parsing using sample logs. Adjust regex for comprehensive coverage:
   ```
   ^(?P<timestamp>\d+\-\d+\-\d+\s+\d+:\d+:\d+)\s+(?P<Event>(Login\s\w+|\w+))\s+(?P<user_id>\d+)?\s?(?P<UserName>\w+)\s+.*?(?P<Session_id>\w+)$
   ```

### Step 3: Investigate Specific Activities  
#### Successful Logins:
1. Query for logs with successful logins:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *successful*
   ```

#### Deletion Events:
2. Query for deletion activities:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *delete*
   ```

#### Session ID Correlation:
3. Investigate activities linked to the suspicious `Session_id`:
   ```
   index=cctv_feed *rij5uu4gt204q0d3eb7jj86okt*
   ```

## Key Findings 🔑

1. **Suspicious Activity**: Multiple login failures followed by a successful login for a suspicious user.
2. **Deletion Events**: Logs confirmed the deletion of CCTV footage.
3. **Correlated Evidence**: The same `Session_id` linked to suspicious activities in web logs and CCTV feed.

## Lessons Learned 🌟

1. **Importance of Log Parsing**: Structured data aids faster investigation.
2. **Field Extraction in SIEM**: Accurate regex ensures comprehensive log coverage.
3. **Session Correlation**: Linking events across datasets is crucial for identifying attackers.

## Tools and Techniques 🛠️

- **Splunk**: For log ingestion, searching, and visualization.
- **Regex**: For custom field extraction.
- **Search Processing Language (SPL)**: For data filtering and correlation.


## Final Thoughts 🎁
This task reinforced the importance of structured log analysis and correlation across datasets. It also demonstrated the need for enabling audit trails and regular monitoring to prevent unauthorized access.

### Answers ✅

1. **How many logs were captured associated with the successful login?**  
   **Answer:** `642`

2. **What is the `Session_id` associated with the attacker who deleted the recording?**  
   **Answer:** `rij5uu4gt204q0d3eb7jj86okt`

3. **What is the name of the attacker found in the logs, who deleted the CCTV footage?**  
   **Answer:** `mmalware`
