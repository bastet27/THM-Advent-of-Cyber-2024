# 🎄 TryHackMe Advent of Cyber 2024 – Day 24: Communication Protocols

## Objectives 🎯
- Understand the MQTT protocol and its role in IoT communication.
- Analyze MQTT traffic using Wireshark to identify commands.
- Reverse-engineer MQTT messages to determine malicious actions.
- Publish the correct MQTT message to restore the smart lighting system.

## Steps 🚀

1. **Exploring MQTT Protocol**:
   - Learned about MQTT’s publish/subscribe model and its use in IoT devices.
   - Identified MQTT components: brokers, clients, and topics.

2. **Analyzing Captured Traffic**:
   - Opened `challenge.pcapng` in Wireshark.
   - Applied the `mqtt` filter to isolate MQTT packets.
   - Identified topics such as `lights/control` and messages like `"off"` responsible for sabotaging the lighting.

3. **Reverse-Engineering Malicious Commands**:
   - Examined MQTT messages to find the correct topic and commands.
   - Discovered that publishing `"on"` under `lights/control` would restore the lights.

4. **Restoring the Lighting System**:
   - Ran `challenge.sh` to simulate the MQTT system.
   - Published the correct message using the `mosquitto_pub` command:
     ```
     mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "lights/control" -m "on"
     ```
   - Successfully restored the lighting system, revealing the flag.

## Key Findings 🔑
- **MQTT Protocol**: Enables communication between IoT devices through a broker and topics.
- **Vulnerability**: Unsecured MQTT communication allowed malicious commands to disrupt the system.
- **Resolution**: Publishing the appropriate command restored functionality.

## Lessons Learned 🌟
- IoT devices require secure communication protocols to prevent exploitation.
- Wireshark is a powerful tool for analyzing and troubleshooting network protocols.
- Understanding MQTT communication is essential for securing smart devices.

### Tools and Techniques 🛠️
- **Wireshark**: Used to analyze MQTT protocol traffic and detect anomalies.
- **Mosquitto_pub**: Command-line utility to publish MQTT messages and resolve issues.

## Final Thoughts 🎁
This challenge emphasized the importance of securing IoT communication protocols like MQTT. By identifying and reversing malicious commands, we restored the lighting system and ensured a brighter SOC-mas.
